# Introduction

Time series data is a collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time. It generally looks like this:
```
       Time         Value         Region
0    1949-01          112         North
1    1949-02          118         South
2    1949-03          132         South
3    1949-04          129         West
4    1949-05          121         North
..       ...          ...
139  1960-08          606         East
140  1960-09          508         South
141  1960-10          461         North
142  1960-11          390         East
143  1960-12          432         North

# What does this program do?
This project is divided into six steps:

<details> 
  <summary> CMake </summary>    
    Dlib is written in C/C++, and your computer needs to *build* the package, so you need something that can automate that build process. Head over to the download link given above and download the file that is the best for you. I recommend the .msi file since it is much easier (tip - make sure to add the Windows PATH during installation). :

This project takes that data and strips it to a _value_ column and a _datetime_ index column (i.e., it is indexed by datetime.
