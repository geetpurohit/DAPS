# Introduction

When presented with a time series data, one can question about its performance in the future. A normal time series data looks like this:
```
       Month  Passengers
0    1949-01          112
1    1949-02          118
2    1949-03          132
3    1949-04          129
4    1949-05          121
..       ...          ...
139  1960-08          606
140  1960-09          508
141  1960-10          461
142  1960-11          390
143  1960-12          432

```
